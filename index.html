                <h2>Fear Grips Borno Citizens</h2>
                <p>After thinking the Boko Haram seige was finally over, 
                    the citizens of Borno were greeted with cries that filled the air.
                    The military base was almost completely devoid of soldiers but the brutal men were back.
                    It seemed that doomsday was upon everybody as all borders were closed indefinitely.
